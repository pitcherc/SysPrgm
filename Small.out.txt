In addition to the file LetFreq.txt, you can find the program cipher.c from the instructor’s website, which is provided for you to prepare your test data. You should use it to generate an encrypted file from a file that you create for testing purposes, run your program with the encrypted file as input, and then compare the output file of your program to the original file. Since such a process involves multiple command lines and you have to run them as often as you need, it would be much convenient to define a makefile and use command make to automate your testing process (a sample makefile can be found in the project folder). Test your program twice, one with a file that contains a small paragraph and the other with a file that contains more than a page of text. Use Linux command diff –s originalTextFile resultingTextFile to see if they are identical. Also add this command line to your makefile so as to perform your test and compare the result automatically.
